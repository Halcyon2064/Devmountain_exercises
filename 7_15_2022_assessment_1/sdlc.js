/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const Analysis_of_Requirements = "In this step developers look to understand what's needed from this project. Normaly, questions like who's going to use it, what problem is solved by it, and what kind of data will be necessary are all answered in this step."
const Design = "This step is used to determine the way the program is going to work. In a way, it asnwers the 'how' in the development cycle. Functionality is decided here"
const Implementation = "This is where the first build of the software is made. Finding glitches or mistakes is of critical importance, and compatibility with other projects relevant to this one must be insured."
const Testing_and_Integration = "For the testing part, a period of in depth testing takes place. Here, all functionality is tested to ensure that it works correctly, possibly through the release of a beta to beta testers that will look for any imperfections. As for integration, the software is released for actual users. This can be more complex than it sounds as the program must be compatible with all others that it interacts with."
const Maintain = "This is the last step. Here, new errors, glitches or bugs that weren't found before are fixed. Also, as time passes a new function may be asked from the program by users, so a new development cycle must begin."
